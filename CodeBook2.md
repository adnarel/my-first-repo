#### CodeBook for "tidy" dataset 
#### "merged_subset_averages.csv"
<br><br>
There are a total of 81 columns and 180 rows in this dataset.
<br><br>
Each row is a summary of smartphone motion data
for one volunteer subject engaged in a certain activity.
<br><br>
Each column represents a variable.  The contents of
the 81 columns are summarized below.
<br><br>
columns 3-42 are extracted and averaged time domain signal data from the raw datasets:
   variable names begin with "t" 

columns 43-81 are extracted and averaged frequency domain signal data from the raw datasets:
   variable names begin with "f"
<br><br>
The raw data was normalized and bounded within [-1,1], so the signal data in columns 3-81 are unitless.
<br><br>


####Abbreviations:

std.dev. = Standard Deviation<br>
3D       = 3-dimensional<br>
grav.    = gravitational<br>
